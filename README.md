> [!WARNING]
> A custom kernel can disable hardware key-attestation, so **Google Wallet** tap-to-pay, Play Integrity **STRONG**, and some banking apps may stop working. Unlocking the bootloader **wipes your data**. Back up your stock `boot.img` first. Flash at your own risk.

## ✅ Standard build defaults

Features are selected when the kernel is built. Every checked-in A14, A15 and A16 configuration currently uses these defaults:

| Component | Standard default | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| **SukiSU Ultra** | **Built in** | Kernel-level root is part of the kernel image. |
| **KPM** | **Enabled** | KPM support is compiled into the kernel. |
| **SUSFS** | **Enabled** | SUSFS support is compiled into the kernel. |
| **NoMount / NMS** | **Disabled** | The NoMount patch stack is not applied by the standard configurations. |
| **BBG** | **Disabled** | BBG is not compiled in by the standard configurations. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AnyKernel3 (AK3) installer has **no volume-key feature selection**. It flashes the already-built kernel image and does not enable optional features during installation. In particular, NoMount/NMS and BBG remain disabled unless they were explicitly enabled at build time.

Other feature flags can vary by device and kernel base. Check the matching JSON file under `configs/` for the exact build-time selection.

## 📱 Supported releases and configuration count

This repository supports OnePlus **A14, A15 and A16** targets. The current inventory contains **158 configurations**:

| Target release | Configuration directory | Count |
|---|---|---:|
| **A14** | `configs/a14/` | **13** |
| **A15** | `configs/a15/` | **74** |
| **A16** | `configs/a16/` | **71** |

The release target, device model, kernel version and source branch must all match your phone. See [compatibility.md](compatibility.md) and the [latest release](https://github.com/cyzrqh/6666/releases/latest) before flashing.

## 🚀 Installation

**Prerequisites:** an unlocked bootloader, a backed-up stock `boot.img`, and [Kernel Flasher](https://github.com/fatalcoder524/KernelFlasher/releases) or another compatible kernel flashing tool.

1. Open the [latest release](https://github.com/cyzrqh/6666/releases/latest).
2. Download the `AK3_…zip` that matches your exact device, A14/A15/A16 release and kernel base.
3. Flash the ZIP with Kernel Flasher or SukiSU Manager.
4. Reboot, then use the compatible SukiSU Manager version shown in the release notes.

The standard kernel ZIP already contains SukiSU, KPM and SUSFS support. NoMount/NMS and BBG are not enabled by default, and the AK3 installer does not offer a volume-key menu to turn them on.

---

## 🔄 Updating &amp; removing

- **Update** — flash a newer ZIP that still matches the same device, target release and kernel base.
- **After a major OTA** — do not reuse the previous kernel ZIP; wait for and flash a matching A14, A15 or A16 build.
- **Remove** — restore the stock boot image or take a compatible OTA that restores the stock kernel.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Can I choose KPM, SUSFS, NoMount/NMS or BBG with the volume keys while flashing?** No. AK3 is non-interactive and contains no volume-key feature selector. KPM and SUSFS are already enabled in the standard image; NoMount/NMS and BBG are not.

**Can the installer enable a feature that was not built into the image?** No. Feature selection happens at build time. To change a build-time flag, use a custom configuration and build a new kernel ZIP.

**Will a custom kernel preserve Play Integrity STRONG or banking compatibility?** Not necessarily. A custom kernel cannot restore hardware key-attestation, and app behavior varies. Keep a stock boot image available for recovery and testing.

## 🛠️ Building it yourself

Via GitHub Actions:

```text
Actions → Build and Release OnePlus Kernels → Run workflow
```

SukiSU is the built-in root option:

```json
[{"type":"SUKISU","hash":"b20dee702035af09cb2ecb5f35443bbc1747f3e6"}]
```

This is the verified SukiSU `builtin` commit used with the pinned SUSFS revisions. SukiSU's build number follows the official `main` history rather than the branch-local count (which incorrectly appeared as 37987). An explicit ref can still be supplied for testing.

The standard configuration flags are:

```json
{
  "susfs": true,
  "kpm": true,
  "NMS": false,
  "bbg": false
}
```

These values are baked into the kernel image. The generated AK3 ZIP does not ask for volume-key choices and does not override them while flashing.

> **First run:** enable **Force toolchain sync before build** (auto-on for releases) — required once to populate the toolchain cache.
